    "# (1) Python's advantages as a general-purpose programming language include its simplicity and readability, making it accessible for beginners and allowing for rapid development (Sunbul, 2024). Python boasts a vast ecosystem of libraries and frameworks for various purposes, facilitating tasks from web development to scientific computing. Its versatility allows it to be used seamlessly across different platforms and operating systems. \n",
    "# (2) Despite its strengths, Python does have some drawbacks. Its performance can be slower than lower-level languages like C or C++, which may pose challenges for computationally intensive tasks or real-time applications (Hadi J, 2024). Additionally, Python's dynamic typing can lead to potential runtime errors that might not be caught until execution. While Python's simplicity is advantageous for beginners, it may need more advanced features in other languages, limiting its suitability for specific niche applications.\n",
    "# (3) Due to its versatility and ecosystem, Data scientists and machine learning engineers often prefer Python over statistically focused languages like R (Let's Decode, 2023). Python's extensive libraries, such as NumPy, pandas, and scikit-learn, provide powerful tools for data manipulation, analysis, and machine learning. Python's straightforward syntax and readability make prototyping and deploying machine learning models easier. Its integration with other technologies, such as web frameworks like Django and Flask, enables seamless development and deployment of machine learning applications. Overall, Python's simplicity, versatility, and extensive libraries make it a preferred choice for data science and machine learning tasks."
